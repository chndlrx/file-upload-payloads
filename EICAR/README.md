# EICAR Antivirus Test Files

## Overview

This folder contains EICAR standard antivirus test files, used to verify whether antivirus or endpoint protection is present and functioning on a file system. Uploading these files to a target can help determine if malicious file uploads would be detected and blocked in a real-world scenario.

## VirusTotal

Each file can be uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to see how many security products detect it. This is useful for gauging detection rates across different AV engines without executing anything malicious.
